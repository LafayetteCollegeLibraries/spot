<h2>Search and Access</h2>

<h3>How to Search</h3>

<p>The search box is located in the upper left part of the repository home page.  To see Advanced Search options, follow the <%= link_to 'Advanced Search', advanced_search_path %> link directly to the right of the main search box.</p>

<p>Default search in the LDR is by full-text keyword, so the search engine will look for the terms across metadata (Title, Author, Description, etc.) and in the full text of resources in the LDR.</p>

<p>Search results are sorted by Relevance by default. To sort by Issue Date or Data Added, click on the <strong>Sort byâ€¦</strong> dropdown menu in the upper right part of the search results page and make your selection.</p>

<h3>Search Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To search for a phrase, use quotation marks. For example, <code>"Civil Rights"</code> will search for the complete phrase "Civil Rights" rather than "Civil" AND "Rights".</li>
  <li>Truncation and wildcard searching ("?" or "*") are not currently supported.</li>
  <li>Use <code>"+"</code> before a term to make it required; Otherwise results matching only some of your terms may be included.</li>
  <li>Use <code>"-"</code> before a word or phrase to exclude.</li>
  <li>Refine search results by clicking on the facets at the left side of the results page.  For example, to view only results in a specific Language or of a given Resource Type.</li>
</ul>
