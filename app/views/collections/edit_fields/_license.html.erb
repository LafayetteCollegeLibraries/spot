  Leaving this intentionally blank. Hyrax is expecting us to use questioning_authority
  to generate a dropdown to select a license. I believe we'll be generating the license,
  based on a depositor agreement, as text or a URI and won't be using the form to
  provide this. Since the `license` field is baked into the Hyrax Collection form
  (see: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/0cc633d/app/forms/hyrax/forms/collection_form.rb#L24
  and https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/0cc633d/app/forms/hyrax/forms/collection_form.rb#L66),
  Changing the `Hyrax::CollectionsController.form_class` seems to require, at the very
  least: copying the class into our codebase, setting this class attribute, then tracking
  changes to the Hyrax class to ensure we're in sync. In an effort to avoid that,
  we'll just leave this form field blank.
