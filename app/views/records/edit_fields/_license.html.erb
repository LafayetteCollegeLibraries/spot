<%#
  Leaving this intentionally blank. Hyrax is expecting us to use questioning_authority
  to generate a dropdown to select a license. I believe we'll be generating the license,
  based on a depositor agreement, as text or a URI and won't be using the form to
  provide this.

  The +license+ field is baked into both the Collection form and BatchEdit form, so in
  an effort to reduce the amount of local editing of those forms in Spot, we'll just
  hide this field for now.
