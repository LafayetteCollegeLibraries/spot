<%#
Hyrax allows five color-related styles to be defined in an admin form:
  - Header background color
  - Header text color
  - Link color
  - Footer link color
  - Primary button background color

Since these are fields we're not expecting to change, we've stripped this
out and will be using our own stylesheets to define these styles. This
partial appends a <style> tag to the <head> with the custom values defined
(see: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/ec78619/app/views/shared/_appearance_styles.html.erb).

This partial is called from the Hyrax head content partial
(see: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/1d6f1a7/app/views/layouts/_head_tag_content.html.erb#L26),
so we'll just leave it blank instead.
