Spot is the future home of the Lafayette College Digital Repository.
It is a [Hyrax]-based Ruby-on-Rails application. For development we us [Docker Compose],
so setting up an environment on your local machine should be as simple as:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LafayetteCollegeLibraries/spot
$ cd spot
$ docker-compose up -d
```

and visit `http://localhost:3000` :tada:.
